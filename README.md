# Rushhour

This assignment is part of the minor Programming at the UvA and this code is written by the group Error 404 Team name not found. 

The goal of the assignment is to write an algorithm than can complete multiple scenarios of the game. Rush Hour is a seemingly simple puzzle with a surprisingly challenging character. In a field of x high and x wide is a red car. To win the game the red car must go to the exit. But other vehicles block the way; cars two units long and trucks three units long, which may only be moved in their direction of travel. They must not change their direction from vertical to horizontal and vice versa.
